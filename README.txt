Review Classification using Binary Perceptron Algorithm

The algorithm uses the 4 following files representing training and testing instances:

train.positive 
train.negative
test.positive 
test.negative

Requirements:

In order to run the code without any changes, all the aforementioned data sets should be 
located in a "./data/" directory. Ideally, the source code (knal.py) and the "./data/" 
directory should be kept in the same folder.

Moreover, matplotlib package is required for graphs; matplotlib package can be installed 
by typing the following in the command line (python3):

pip3 install matplotlib


Running the code:

Assuming the requirements are met, the code can be run directly from the command line
by typing:

python3 knal.py
